The objective was to extract key details including Job Title, Location, Description Snippet, and Application Link, and structure this data into a pandas DataFrame.\n","\n","The project utilized Playwright within a Google Colab environment for its capability to handle dynamic web content.\n","\n","**Solving Process:**\n","\n","1.  **Environment Setup:** Necessary libraries (Playwright, pandas) were installed, and Playwright browsers were set up in the Colab environment.\n","2.  **Agent Development (Navigation):** Initial code was developed to navigate to the specified career page URLs using Playwright's asynchronous API.\n","3.  **Agent Development (Extraction - Iterative Attempts):** Multiple attempts were made to develop the extraction logic:\n","    *   Initial attempts used Playwright's element locators and `wait_for_selector` with varying timeouts and states. These attempts consistently failed to locate the main job listing elements (`div.gc-card[data-job-result]`, `div[role=\"listitem\"][data-testid=\"job_listing\"]`, `.job-tile`) across all three sites, resulting in timeouts and zero extracted jobs.\n","    *   An attempt was made to navigate, wait for a fixed long duration (`asyncio.sleep`), retrieve the full HTML content, and then parse it using BeautifulSoup. While navigation and HTML retrieval were successful, the BeautifulSoup selectors also failed to find any job listings in the captured static HTML.\n","    *   Further attempts with Playwright focusing on different waiting strategies (e.g., `domcontentloaded` followed by a long fixed wait) combined with the element locators still resulted in the inability to find job listing elements.\n","4.  **Data Structuring:** Code was developed to structure the extracted data into a pandas DataFrame with the required columns. This step was successful in creating the DataFrame structure, but it remained empty due to the lack of extracted data.\n","5.  **Test Cases:** The agent was run on the target URLs (Google, Meta, Amazon). The test runs confirmed the navigation success but consistently failed to extract any job data, reinforcing the issues encountered during development.\n","6.  **Appendix Generation:** An appendix was generated detailing the absence of output files (as no data was extracted), how to construct a process log from the execution outputs, providing snippets of the retrieved raw HTML, and noting the absence of JSON-LD usage.\n","\n","**Key Findings:**\n","\n","*   The Playwright environment was successfully set up in Google Colab.\n","*   Navigation to the target career pages (Google, Meta, Amazon) was consistently successful.\n","*   The core challenge was the *extraction* of job details. Repeated attempts using Playwright's element locators and `wait_for_selector` failed to find the job listing elements on all three websites, indicating the selectors used were not suitable for the dynamic loading or structure of these sites.\n","*   Attempting to scrape by retrieving HTML after a long fixed wait and parsing with BeautifulSoup also failed to yield job data, suggesting the job listings were not reliably present in the static HTML captured or the BeautifulSoup selectors were also incorrect.\n","*   Despite successful navigation and the ability to retrieve HTML, the agent was **unable to extract any job postings** from Google, Meta, or Amazon career pages using the implemented strategies and selectors.\n","*   The final output DataFrame was empty as a result of the extraction failures.\n","\n","**Insights or Next Steps:**\n","\n","*   The dynamic and complex nature of the target career websites requires more sophisticated scraping techniques than simple selector-based extraction after page load.\n","*   Future steps should involve in-depth, site-specific analysis of how job listings are loaded (e.g., observing network requests, dynamic rendering via JavaScript, potential use of iframes) to identify more robust extraction methods, potentially involving interacting with the page (like scrolling or clicking load buttons) or targeting API calls.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e5fcdeb6"},"source":["## Next Steps: Site-Specific Analysis and Strategy\n","\n","The previous attempts to extract job listings by waiting for general selectors or implementing a generic scrolling mechanism were unsuccessful. The `wait_for_selector` calls continued to time out, and no job elements were found. This indicates that the target websites employ more complex and dynamic methods for loading job content that our current approach is not capturing.\n","\n","To move forward, the critical next step, as outlined in the plan, is to perform a **detailed, site-specific analysis** of how job listings are loaded on Google, Meta, and Amazon career pages. This manual analysis using browser developer tools is essential to identify:\n","\n","*   **Precise Selectors:** What are the reliable CSS selectors or Playwright locators for job title, location, snippet, and application link *after* the content has loaded?\n","*   **Loading Mechanisms:** Are job listings loaded via scrolling, clicking a \"Load More\" button, or through specific API calls (XHR/Fetch requests)?\n","*   **Dynamic Content:** Is the job data embedded in the initial HTML, injected via JavaScript, or loaded into an iframe?\n","\n","**Recommended Manual Analysis Steps (using browser Developer Tools):**\n","\n","1.  Navigate to the career page.\n","2.  Open Developer Tools (F12).\n","3.  Observe the \"Network\" tab while the page loads and as you interact (scroll, click). Look for data being fetched.\n","4.  Inspect the HTML (\"Elements\" tab) to understand the structure containing job information.\n","\n","Once this analysis is complete and you have identified the specific loading mechanisms and reliable selectors for each site, we can update the Playwright code to implement a tailored extraction strategy for each URL.\n","\n","Based on the findings from your manual analysis, we can then proceed with the following steps from the revised plan:\n","\n","*   **Agent Development - Advanced Navigation & Interaction**: Implement site-specific interactions (e.g., specific scrolling logic, clicking buttons).\n","*   **Agent Development - Refined Extraction**: Implement extraction logic using the identified precise selectors.\n","*   Continue with Data Structuring, Test Cases, Results Aggregation, and Appendix Generation.\n","\n","Please perform the manual analysis and provide the findings, and I will help you translate those findings into Playwright code."]}]}
